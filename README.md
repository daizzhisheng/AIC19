This repository contains our source code of Track 1 - City-scale multi-camera vehicle tracking at the [AI City Challenge Workshop at CVPR 2019](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/)   
The source code of Track 1 is built in Python, and is executed on Windows.
## Introduction

### AI City Challenge Workshop at CVPR 2019 
The challenge focus on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) problems, such as:

#### Track1 - City-scale multi-camera vehicle tracking
#### Track2 - City-scale multi-camera vehicle re-identification
#### Track3 - Traffic anomaly detection â€“ Leveraging unsupervised learning to detect anomalies such as lane violation, illegal U-turns, wrong-direction driving, etc.

The pipeline is as follow:
